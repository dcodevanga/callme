# Call Me 📞

> "Made by Devanga Rajkhowa. Because it was needed."

**Call Me** is a modern, minimalist web application designed to solve a simple problem: sharing a direct "Call Now" link for phone numbers in places where direct calling isn't natively supported.

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Modern Aesthetics**: Built with a "dark mode first" approach, featuring glassmorphism effects and smooth animations.
- **⚡ Instant Generator**: Input any phone number to instantly create a shareable link.
- **📱 Smart Caller Mode**: When a generated link is visited, the app transforms into a focused "Call Now" interface.
- **🛡️ Privacy Focused**: No data storage. The phone number is encoded directly into the URL hash/query.
- **🌍 Responsive**: Perfectly optimized for mobile and desktop screens.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Generator Mode
- Open the site.
- Enter your phone number (e.g., `+1 555-0123`).
- Click **Get Link**.
- Copy the generated URL to your clipboard.

### 2. Caller Mode
- Share the link with anyone.
- When they open it, they see a big permission-based **Call Now** button.
- Clicking it immediately launches their device's phone dialer.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** (Semantic & Accessible)
- **CSS3** (Variables, Flexbox, Glassmorphism)
- **JavaScript** (Vanilla ES6+)
- **No Frameworks**: Extremely lightweight and fast.
